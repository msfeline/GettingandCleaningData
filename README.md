GettingandCleaningData
======================


This readme file describes how run_analysis.R script works.

Unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
for me, i use the default "UCI HAR Dataset" folder name

Double check that the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" and the run_analysis.R script are stored in the current working directory.
Use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio.

Two output files should be generated in the current working directory after 1-2mins.

1) merged_data.txt : it contains a data frame called cleanedData.

2) data_with_means.txt : it contains a data frame called result
